// 1. Memory in a computer is like a large storage area where data is kept so that the processors can quickly access it.

// 2. Compile Time is when your program code is translated into machine code (the binary instructions that the computer's processor understands).
// This is done by a compiler. At compile time, the compiler checks your code for syntax errors and converts it into an executable file.

// 3. Runtime is when your compiled program is actually running, executing the instructions that were generated at compile time.

// 4. The STACK is a special region of memory that operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. It's used for managing function calls and local variables.
// When a function is called, a block of memory (called a stack frame) is pushed onto the stack, and when the function returns, that block is popped off the stack.
// Characterists:
// - Fast access; fixed size, usually limited, automatically managed (allocated/deallocated) by the system; used for local variables, function parameters, and
// return addresses.

// 5. The HEAP is another region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike the stack, memory in the heap is manually allocated and freed by the 
// programmer, and it does not follow a strict order.
// Characterists:
// - Flexible size, can grow and shrink as needed; slower access compared to the stack due to its unstructured nature; requires manual management (allocation
// and deallocation) by the programmer; used for data that needs to persist across function calls or whose size is not known at compile time
